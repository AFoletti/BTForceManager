git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
cp -r frontend/build/* .
cp frontend/build/.gitignore .
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages
```

**Method B - Using GitHub Actions:**
- Go to your repository Settings → Pages
- Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
- GitHub will suggest a workflow for React apps

4. **Access your app:**
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```

### Option 2: Other Static Hosting

The `frontend/build/` folder contains a complete static website. Upload it to:
- Netlify (drag & drop build folder)
- Vercel (connect GitHub repo)
- Any web host (upload via FTP)

## 🎨 Design System

The app uses a custom military tactical theme:

**Colors:**
- Background: Deep dark gray-blue (#14161a)
- Primary: Aerospace Orange (#FF4F00)
- Secondary: Army Green (#454B1B)
- Accent: Dark Orange (#C76E00)

**Components:**
- Custom tactical panels with borders and shadows
- Status badges with color coding
- Data tables with hover effects
- Smooth transitions and interactions

## 💾 Data Management

### Default Data
The app includes sample data for "Gray Death Legion" force with:
- 2 mechs (Atlas AS7-D, Marauder MAD-3R)
- 2 pilots (Grayson Carlyle, Lori Kalmar)
- 3 repair actions with formulas
- 1000 starting warchest

### How to Add Your Data
1. Go to **Data Editor** tab
2. Edit JSON for mechs, pilots, repair actions, or force info
3. Click **Save** to update
4. Use **Export** button to backup your data

### JSON Structure Examples

**Add a Mech:**
```json
{
  "id": "mech-3",
  "name": "Warhammer WHM-6R",
  "status": "Operational",
  "pilot": "Your Pilot Name",
  "bv": 1299,
  "weight": 70,
  "image": "https://optional-image-url.jpg",
  "activityLog": []
}
```

**Add a Pilot:**
```json
{
  "id": "pilot-3",
  "name": "Your Pilot Name",
  "gunnery": 4,
  "piloting": 5,
  "injuries": 0,
  "activityLog": []
}
```

**Add a Repair Action:**
```json
{
  "id": "repair-4",
  "name": "Reload Ammo",
  "formula": "(weight/10)",
  "makesUnavailable": false
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

The app has been tested with:
- ✅ Pilot injury management (+/- buttons)
- ✅ Mission creation and completion
- ✅ Data editor with save/reset
- ✅ Export functionality
- ✅ Tab navigation
- ✅ Force selector
- ⚠️ Repair system (works but may need manual dropdown interaction)

## ⚠️ Known Notes

### Repair System
The repair system is functional but the dropdown selections may require clicking twice or manual interaction in some browsers. The logic is correct:
1. Select a mech from dropdown
2. Select a repair action from dropdown  
3. Cost panel should appear with "Perform Repair" button
4. If button doesn't appear, try reselecting the dropdowns

You can test and verify this works in your browser after deployment.

### Image URLs
The default data includes Unsplash image URLs. For production:
- Replace with your own mech images
- Or remove the image fields if not needed
- Images are optional for all mechs and forces

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the app locally:** Open http://localhost:3000 and test all features
2. **Customize your data:** Add your mechs, pilots, and forces via Data Editor
3. **Export your data:** Backup before deployment
4. **Build for production:** `cd frontend && yarn build`
5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Follow deployment steps above
6. **Share with your group:** Send them the GitHub Pages URL
