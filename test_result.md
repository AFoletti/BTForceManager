    message: "TESTING COMPLETE - Most features working excellently. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Repair System has UI interaction problems where dropdown selections don't properly enable the 'Perform Repair' button. The data and calculations work correctly, but the component state management for enabling the repair action appears broken. This prevents users from actually performing repairs despite having all the necessary data and calculations working."
